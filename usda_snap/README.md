# Map of SNAP retailers

SNAP is the Supplemental Nutition Assistance Program.

Data comes from [this United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) ArcGIS server](http://snap-load-balancer-244858692.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/retailer/MapServer/0) extracted on February 21, 2017, using [pyesridump](https://github.com/openaddresses/pyesridump). [I found it on Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/snap-retail-locator) under the title "SNAP Retail Locator".
